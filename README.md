# Homebrew Composer

This repository contains a Homebrew formula for installing
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) that depends on [shivammathur/php](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php) instead of php
from homebrew/core.

```shell
# Add tap
brew tap nhedger/composer

# Update homebrew
brew update

# Install composer
brew install nhedger/composer/composer
```
